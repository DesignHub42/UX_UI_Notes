They will always be in the same place, with the same theme, same colours, and naming conventions unless they are clicked which will make them change colour. The navigation bar will be at the top while the footer will be at the bottom. The Aa icon on the top will let users change text size, and the mode icon will let them switch between light and dark mode.

At the bottom of the page, the Carbon Footprint Calculator section will be located. It will have a short explanation and a button to open the calculator so users can check their energy impact - This design would make it easy for users to understand what the company offers through. An image can help customers understand what the green technology is about as well as entertaining the reader since it would be boring to read just a whole page of text. Moreover, the service sections help users quickly find page that they are looking for. And the carbon footprint calculator would encourage them to be more energy-conscious.
There will be solar panels page which will contain all information about using solar energy. It will also explain how solar panels work, why they are good and what types of panels are available at Rolsa Technologies. Instead of letting users book an installation directly, the page will have a “Book a Consultation” button which means that users will  have to talk to an expert first before deciding to install solar panels. The option to schedule an installation will be sent to the user on email, only after consultation  – Using this approach, user will have a chance to find all information about solar panels and installation before making decision.

There will be EV charging page which will contain all information about EV chargers. It will also explain why it’s useful to charge at home, how much money and time it saves and what types of chargers exist.

By knowing more about smart energy tools, they can find easy ways to save money and make home more efficient. The section on green energy technologies will keep users informed about energy products that are now on market. This page will also help users know how to watch their electricity use and make smarter choices to save power at their homes.
There will be a carbon footprint calculator page where users will be asked to enter details about their energy use, driving and flights to calculate their carbon footprint. The system will use a formula to calculate emissions and show a total monthly CO2 footprint. It will also provide advice on how to reduce energy waste - using this logic, users will see how their actions affecting environment. After checking results of their footprint, they might look for ways to move to lower emissions. And this might make them start to think about saving energy and wasting less energy.
There will be a consultation booking page that will allow users to schedule a consultation for solar panels, EV chargers or smart home energy. They will be asked to choose a date, provide their contact details, and choose the service they are interested in (solar panels, EV chargers, or smart home energy). After submitting the booking, they will receive a confirmation email on the email provided – using this logic, users will be able to schedule a consultation for any service through the form. Each input field will have to be validated, making sure that wrong format or incorrect input has been sent to the database. Getting an email confirmation for the user might be very important so that they know that consultation is definitely booked for them.
There will be installation booking page that will be only available after a consultation. Once the consultation is completed, users will receive an email with a link to book their installation. They will have to select the type of installation, choose a date and confirm their booking. A confirmation email will be sent after the booking is successfully completed – this approach makes sure that only those who had consultation can book an installation because otherwise, it will lead to the mistakes such as choosing system that doesn’t fit to their house. Sending a booking link by email after a consultation is the only way to prevent issue with unnecessary cancellations.

There will be a profile page where user will be able to see all their bookings and personal details. Logged-in users will be able to view past consultations, energy tracking reports and account settings. If they need to, they can also update their information or delete their account – this approach gives users control over their personal data and bookings that gives the user freedom and trust to our service. It allows them to keep track of consultations and installation and makes it easier to refer back to past services. The abiliy to update details making sure that users’ data is up to date, and means that if user changed an email address and still want to use service he won't be able to then just leave, so this feature definitely has to be implemented, preventing an issues with communication. If the user decides that want to delete an account, they should have a delete option that makes sure that their data is removed from the system, and trust and security will be improved.
There will be a register page where customers can sign up by entering their name, email, and password and accepting the terms and conditions, which will be linked to the terms and conditions page. They must also agree to the terms and conditions, which will be linked on the page. The system will check if the email and password meet the rules. If the email is already used or the password is too weak, an error message will appear.  If everything is correct, user will see a message saying they can now log in. It will save this information in the SQL database. There will also be a link to login on the page – the registration form doesn’t have to include lots of data, as company doesn’t need too much data on the user. Length check helps the customer to have more secure password that can protect them from attacks in the future, while presence check helps the system to not get non-values in the system. Saving the information into the SQL is crucial as it is used to retrieve data when logging in.
There will be a login page where users can enter their email and password to sign in, with their details being fetched from the SQL database. If they forget their password, they can click on forgot password, enter their email and get a reset link by email. There will also be a link to register for new users. Admins and employees will have accounts already made and will be able to reset their passwords if needed. If the user enters the wrong details, an error message will appear. After logging in, the register and login buttons will disappear and be replaced by a log out option – the only way to allow only registered users to log in is to fetch the information from the SQL database. Sometimes human errors can occur, so the option ‘forgot password’ should be always available in the log in page. In case of any errors, users will determine on what to do by following a  clear error messages. If the log in and sign up options will disappear and only the option to log out is available, it will help customers visually identify if they are logged in or not.
The accessibility panel will be on every page and will help users adjust how the website looks. The Aa icon will change text size and the mode icon will switch between light and dark mode. The website will remember these settings, so users don’t have to change them every time they visit – the accessibility panel should always be available to make the website more user-friendly attract a wider range of users and increase traffic. Some users may have difficulty reading small text or prefer dark mode. Making sure that these saves are saved prevents an issue that after going to another page user has to apply these settings again. If savings are saved, website becoming much more convenient to use.

Passwords will be encrypted, and all user activities (bookings, tracking and settings) will be stored in a database -Protecting personal data from unauthorised access is the goal number one. Encrypting passwords is making sure that data that may be exposed to passwords is still unreadable. Storing user activities in a database is the only option to allow users to access their consultation history, energy tracking report and settings anytime.
