Proposal
The solution will contain consistent layout, and be present on every page, for the navigation bar, footer and accessibility icons. They will always be in the same place, with the same theme, same colours, and naming conventions unless they are clicked which will make them change colour. The navigation bar will be at the top while the footer will be at the bottom. The Aa icon on the top will let users change text size, and the mode icon will let them switch between light and dark mode. This will make the site easier to use for different people.
There will be a home page that will contain an image with a welcoming message. The home page will also contain sections about Solar Panels,  EV Charging and Smart Home Energy and each section will have a picture,  short description and a “Learn More” button. At the bottom of the page, the Carbon Footprint Calculator section will be located. It will have a short explanation and a button to open the calculator so users can check their energy impact.
There will be solar panels page which will contain all information about using solar energy. It will also explain how solar panels work, why they are good and what types of panels are available at Rolsa Technologies. Instead of letting users book an installation directly, the page will have a “Book a Consultation” button which means that users will  have to talk to an expert first before deciding to install solar panels. The option to schedule an installation will be sent to the user on email, only after consultation.
There will be EV charging page which will contain all information about EV chargers. It will also explain why it’s useful to charge at home, how much money and time it saves and what types of chargers exist. Like the solar panels page, there will be a “Book a Consultation” button, so users will get advice before booking an installation.
There will be Smart Home Energy page which will be about tracking and reducing energy use. It will explain how people can monitor electricity in their home and save power. It will also have a section about the latest green energy technologies. This page will explain how users can measure their energy and lower their carbon footprint, and will have a button that will let user to go to the toll for calculating and tracking energy usage.
There will be a carbon footprint calculator page where users will be asked to enter details about their energy use, driving and flights to calculate their carbon footprint. The system will use a formula to calculate emissions and show a total monthly CO2 footprint. It will also provide advice on how to reduce energy waste.
There will be a consultation booking page that will allow users to schedule a consultation for solar panels, EV chargers or smart home energy. They will be asked to choose a date, provide their contact details, and choose the service they are interested in (solar panels, EV chargers, or smart home energy). After submitting the booking, they will receive a confirmation email on the email provided.
There will be installation booking page that will be only available after a consultation. Once the consultation is completed, users will receive an email with a link to book their installation. They will have to select the type of installation, choose a date and confirm their booking. A confirmation email will be sent after the booking is successfully completed.
There will be a policy page which will contain the most up to date policy.
There will be a terms and conditions page that will contain the most up to date terms and conditions.
There will be a  profile page where user will be able to see all their bookings and personal details. Logged-in users will be able to view past consultations, energy tracking reports and account settings. If they need to, they can also update their information or delete their account.
There will be a register page where customers can sign up by entering their name, email, and password and accepting the terms and conditions, which will be linked to the terms and conditions page. They must also agree to the terms and conditions, which will be linked on the page. The system will check if the email and password meet the rules. If the email is already used or the password is too weak, an error message will appear.  If everything is correct, user will see a message saying they can now log in. It will save this information in the SQL database. There will also be a link to login on the page.
There will be a login page where users can enter their email and password to sign in, with their details being fetched from the SQL database. If they forget their password, they can click on forgot password, enter their email and get a reset link by email. There will also be a link to register for new users. Admins and employees will have accounts already made and will be able to reset their passwords if needed. If the user enters the wrong details, an error message will appear. After logging in, the register and login buttons will disappear and be replaced by a log out option.
The accessibility panel will be on every page and will help users adjust how the website looks. The Aa icon will change text size and the mode icon will switch between light and dark mode. The website will remember these settings, so users don’t have to change them every time they visit.
There will be a policy page which will contain the most up to date policy.
There will be a terms and conditions page that will contain the most up to date terms and conditions.
The website will also keep user data safe. Passwords will be encrypted, and all user activity (bookings, tracking and settings) will be stored in a database.
